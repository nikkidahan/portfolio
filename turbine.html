    	<h2 style="border-bottom:1px solid #000;">wind turbine project</h2>
	
	<p class="two">
 		Back in high school, I built a fully functioning wind turbine. 
		This project was sponsored by the University of Vermont College 
		of Engineering.The goal was to build a sustainable energy resource. 
		My team chose to build a wind turbine because we considered it 
		to be one of the most realistic energy resources for the future.
 		We created multiple designs for the blades and tested many materials 
		in order to determine which combination produced the most energy.

		After completing our wind turbine, we presented our results to the judges, and our team won the
