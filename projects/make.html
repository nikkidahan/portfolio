	<p class="two">

		Four other students and I are in the process of developing the Tufts MAKE Team. 
		The MAKE Team is a product design club inspired by <a target=_blank href="http://makermedia.com/"> 
		Maker Media</a>, which encourages a hands-on approach to problem solving. 
		<br>

		In Fall 2013, we will be building assistive technology devices. Currently, while we are still 
		creating the club, we are prototyping with an Oreo Cookie Separator. While this is not 
		necessarily assistive technology (though maybe some people need help separating oreos!), 
		we are designing and implementing the device to gain skills in the area for next semester. 
		Much like when actually prototyping a device, "prototyping" the club allows for us to 
		diagnose any issues in the team before we start building technology that matters.

		To develop our Oreo Cookie Separator, we first brainstormed using stickie notes. During this 
		process, we organized the stickie notes based on a method of separation, such as the user 
		inserting the cookie into a slot or a mechanical claw picking up the cookie.
		Some methods were a little more realistic than others, especially given our two month time restriction. 
		We also categorized the stickie notes based on similar ideas. Some ideas were based on how to insert 
		the cookie into the device while others were concerned with splitting the cookie apart. 
		After narrowing down the many ideas into one, we drafted our idea onto graphing paper, 
		tested it out on some wood and then brought our creation to SolidWorks.

		<br>
	<p class="two">
		We used a laser cutter to create the device out of acrylic. In our device, the 
		Oreo is essentially locked into an acrylic chamber, with a space where the cream is 
		located. Into that space, we pushed a thin piece of acrylic, which pushes the cream out. 
		We tried multiple shapes for this crucial piece, such as a rectangle with a sharpened 
		edge, one with a circular crevice and one with an inward v shape. The shape that worked 
		best is the one shown, the outward v shape. While it was fun to go 
		through the design process from start to finish, I am excited for next 
		semester when we will create a device that offers a real purpose rather than splitting 
		apart a delicious cookie.
