		I've always been an advocate for science, technology, engineering and math 
		(STEM) education, so during the summer of 2012 I decided to teach young 
		students how to build and program robots. We taught them the fundamentals 
		of computer programming using blocks. The students then wrote their own 
		programs using the blocks, and other students had to act out the program,
		much like a robot would.

		They then built their robots out of Legos and motors, and actually programmed them
		on the computers. The students were obsessed with this new power we seemed to have given them,
		as they could make their creations move without touching them, but we reminded them that 
		they have the power to do even more using science and technology.
