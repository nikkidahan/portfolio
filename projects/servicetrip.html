		I went on multiple trips to Central America to do community service. 
		We refurbrished a rural school house, built a tree nursery and installed 
		camera traps in the rain forest.While working at the elementary school,
		we met a 16 year old boy who suffered from meningitis as a baby. He told 
		us that because his mother couldn't afford the care he needed, he was 
		"too dumb" to be in high school with his peers. We quickly took him under 
		our wing and nicknamed him "Chicken Bros" after his favorite restaurant.When
		we came back a second time, Chicken Bros had graduated, but he came back 
		to the elementary school just to see us.

	<p class="two">
		We also built a tree nursury to enable the locals to reforest. The sun is too powerful
		for the young tree saplings to grow, so we had to build a protective shelter.
		Once they grow a little, they are then transported to live in the forest, and 
		more saplings are introduced into the nursery.

	<p class="two">
		We installed camera traps in the rain forest to monitor the wildlife species in the area.
		The place we were staying was right between two major national parks, and 
		acts as a bridge between those two parks. We discovered a puma, a jaguar and an ocelot 
		on the camera traps. Seeing these large predators meant that the ecosystem was thriving.
		However, we also discovered three poachers. We promptly notified the police, and the
		poachers were immediately found and arrested!
