		During my sophomore year, I founded Tufts Confessions. Tufts Confessions offers 
		the Tufts community a confidential resource. After submitting a completely anonymous 
		confession, the confessions are displayed on the web page for all to see or comment on. 
		Some students have hilarious confessions about what they did last weekend, while 
		others have more serious confessions, such as sexual assault, depression, eating disorders 
		or loneliness. I was very pleased to see the overwhelming support for the students suffering 
		from these issues. Many students posted comments to these confessions offering help or support, 
		while others went as far to make an email account for anyone who needed help. Others offered many
		resources for those struggling with sexual assault or mood disorders. In the following weeks, 
		we received many confessions from students stating that they had previously struggled with 
		these issues, but after seeing the support from their fellow Jumbos, they were confident enough 
		to seek professional help. Maybe Tufts Confessions supplies hearty laughs to thousands of 
		people each day, but providing students with the courage to seek help when they need it 
		is by far its greatest gift.

 		Currently, I lead an 18 student team to comb through each confession submitted, to 
		make sure no confessions get posted that insult another student. The page was 
		featured in the Tufts Daily, Inside Higher Ed and HerCampus Tufts. 
		The page peaked at 59,000 page views, 2,200 interactive users and 1,500 subscribers.
